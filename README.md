# Numpy_DataMining
A set of little pieces numpy-python programs sample, implemented basic statistical/data mining algorithms. 

##Notes
SVM: When precision is crucial. Is expensive. Large dimension, less data set. 
Logistic regression: not good in percision; cannot deal with large dimension, large data set.
