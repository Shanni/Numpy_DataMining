Implementation of SVM dual formulation - stochastic gradient ascent.

Challenge:
After I calculate a[k]'s, I have trouble selecting the support vecoters, where I realize I need correct support vectors to compute weigh vector and bias; I did with correct algorithm, but It may not produce correct answers.
